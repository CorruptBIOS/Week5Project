		<h1>Common Exercises</h1>
		<p>The following are common exercises that we encourage our clients to as part of their daily exercise routine.</p>
        <dl>
            <dt>Burpee</dt>
            <dd>Burpees are a great, full body exercise to increase your strength and endurance. Begin in a standing position, drop into a squat and extend your hands forward, kick your feet back and then forward again quickly, and then jump up from a squattted position.</br>
			</dd>
            
            <dt>Plank</dt>
            <dd>Planks build your core strength. To perform a plank, get in a push up position and rest your forearms on the floor. Hold the position as long as you can.</br>
			</dd>
            
            <dt>Mountain Climber</dt>
            <dd>Mountain Climbers are a good cardio exercise. Place your hands on the floor in a push up position, then bring on knee up to your waist and then switch to another knee as quickly as you can (as though you are climbing a mountain)</br>
			</dd>
        </dl>
